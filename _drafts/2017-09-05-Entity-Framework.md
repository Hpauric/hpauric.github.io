Why do we need Entity Framework?

You can use Entity Framework for code-first implementations. This allows you to define your models in code, and let Entity Framework generate the database for you.

It allows you to work at a higher level of abstraction.


Why do we need an ORM?


There is a lot of controversy around Object Relational Models

[ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html)

> The charges against them can be summarized in that they are complex, and provide only a leaky abstraction over a relational data store. Their complexity implies a grueling learning curve and often systems using an ORM perform badly - often due to naive interactions with the underlying database.
There is a lot of truth to these charges, but such charges miss a vital piece of context. The object/relational mapping problem is hard.
