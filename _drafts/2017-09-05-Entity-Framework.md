Why do we need Entity Framework? Why do we need an ORM?

You can use Entity Framework for code-first implementations. This allows you to define your models in code, and let Entity Framework generate the database for you.

representing loosely-structured, heirarchical data. Relational databases can't do this very well. Many common types of data are intrinsically heirarchical and loosely structured, so storing them in an RDBMS can be difficult. Examples: books, articles, and most other written documentation. HTML. Search indexes. Filesystems. Game worlds. Classical music scores. It's just easier to model some things this way.

It allows you to work at a higher level of abstraction.


Should you use Entity Framework? It remains, as far as I can tell, the strategic direction for data access on Microsoftâ€™s platform, and once you have worked out the basics you should be able to put together simple database applications more quickly and more naturally than with manually coded SQL.

There is a lot of controversy around Object Relational Models

[Object-Relational Mapping is the Vietnam of Computer Science](https://blog.codinghorror.com/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science/)

[ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html)

> The charges against them can be summarized in that they are complex, and provide only a leaky abstraction over a relational data store. Their complexity implies a grueling learning curve and often systems using an ORM perform badly - often due to naive interactions with the underlying database.
There is a lot of truth to these charges, but such charges miss a vital piece of context. The object/relational mapping problem is hard.
