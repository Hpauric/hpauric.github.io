Why do we need Entity Framework? Why do we need an ORM?

You can use Entity Framework for code-first implementations. This allows you to define your models in code, and let Entity Framework generate the database for you.

representing loosely-structured, heirarchical data. Relational databases can't do this very well. Many common types of data are intrinsically heirarchical and loosely structured, so storing them in an RDBMS can be difficult. Examples: books, articles, and most other written documentation. HTML. Search indexes. Filesystems. Game worlds. Classical music scores. It's just easier to model some things this way.

It allows you to work at a higher level of abstraction.


Should you use Entity Framework? It remains, as far as I can tell, the strategic direction for data access on Microsoftâ€™s platform, and once you have worked out the basics you should be able to put together simple database applications more quickly and more naturally than with manually coded SQL.

There is a lot of controversy around Object Relational Models

[Object-Relational Mapping is the Vietnam of Computer Science](https://blog.codinghorror.com/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science/)

[ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html)

> The charges against them can be summarized in that they are complex, and provide only a leaky abstraction over a relational data store. Their complexity implies a grueling learning curve and often systems using an ORM perform badly - often due to naive interactions with the underlying database.
There is a lot of truth to these charges, but such charges miss a vital piece of context. The object/relational mapping problem is hard.

> Many people treat the relational database "like a crazy aunt who's shut up in an attic and whom nobody wants to talk about"[3]. In this world-view they just want to deal with in-memory data-structures and let the ORM deal with the database. This way of thinking can work for small applications and loads, but it soon falls apart once the going gets tough. Essentially the ORM can handle about 80-90% of the mapping problems, but that last chunk always needs careful work by somebody who really understands how a relational database works.

> Mapping to a relational database involves lots of repetitive, boiler-plate code. A framework that allows me to avoid 80% of that is worthwhile even if it is only 80%. The problem is in me for pretending it's 100% when it isn't.

## Using Entity Framework

> The main class that coordinates Entity Framework functionality for a given data model is the database context class. You create this class by deriving from the `System.Data.Entity.DbContext` class. In your code you specify which entities are included in the data model.

### Connection String


Enter this text in the `WebConfig.cs` file in your project.

```html
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="[YOURMODELNAMEHERE]Context"    connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\[YOURDATABASENAMEHERE].mdf;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
  </connectionStrings>
```
