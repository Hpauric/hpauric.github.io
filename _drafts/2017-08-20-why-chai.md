Why Chai

I like Mocha as runner with Chai as assertion library and some extra Chai plugins for more specific assertions (Sinon etc). To run the test I use grunt-mocha (phantomjs) and grunt-mocha-test (node).

 I prefer how Mocha now supports promises and also has many reporters, and how Chai has a shitload of assertion plugins.
 
 he reason to use chai/should/expect and other assertion libraries is they generally add more assertion types (beyond true/false) to the table. They will test for matching values, execute parameters, and do lots of other things.
