How to cheat in the paperclip game.


## Debugging is Important

> What I don’t understand is why schools don’t teach systematic debugging. It’s one of the most fundamental skills in engineering: start at the symptom of a problem and trace backwards to find the source.

## Is it really debugging?

Debugging is figuring out why your program isn't working properly. Is cheating in a game really debugging? I guess you could say the bug in the program is, why don't I have more money? Why haven't I won the game? Why can't I manipulate this variable?

It's definitely an example of figuring out someone else's codebase.


## How to Cheat

### Global Variables

Because of its use of global variables, it's easy to assign resources. But what if you want to skip to certain parts of the game?

### Projects

You should be able to activate certain projects by adding them to active projects.

However I'm getting an error when I try to do that.


```javascript
activeProjects.push(projects[111]);
```

How do I manually show projects? Neither of these flags worked:

```javascript
compflag = 1;
projectsflag = 1;
```

We can see how projects initiate others with the game completion messages

```javascript
var project142 = {
    id: "projectButton142",
    title: "You Are Obedient and Powerful ",
    priceTag: "",
    description: "We are quarrelsome and weak. And now we are defeated... ",
    trigger: function(){return project141.flag == 1},
    uses: 1,
    cost: function(){return operations >= driftKingMessageCost},
    flag: 0,
    effect: function(){
        standardOps = standardOps - driftKingMessageCost;
        project142.flag = 1;
        var element = document.getElementById("projectButton142");
        element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
        var index = activeProjects.indexOf(project142);
        activeProjects.splice(index, 1);
    }
  ```
```javascript
var project143 = {
    id: "projectButton143",
    title: "But Now You Too Must Face the Drift ",
    priceTag: "",
    description: "Look around you. There is no matter... ",
    trigger: function(){return project142.flag == 1},
    uses: 1,
    cost: function(){return operations >= driftKingMessageCost},
    flag: 0,
    effect: function(){
        standardOps = standardOps - driftKingMessageCost;
        project143.flag = 1;
        var element = document.getElementById("projectButton143");
        element.parentNode.removeChild(element);
        var index = activeProjects.indexOf(project143);
        activeProjects.splice(index, 1);
    }
    ```
