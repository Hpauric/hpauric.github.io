How to cheat in the paperclip game.


## Debugging is Important

> What I don’t understand is why schools don’t teach systematic debugging. It’s one of the most fundamental skills in engineering: start at the symptom of a problem and trace backwards to find the source.

## Is it really debugging?

Debugging is figuring out why your program isn't working properly. I guess you could say the bug in the program is, why don't I have more money? Why haven't I won the game? Why can't I manipulate this variable?


## How to Cheat



Because of its use of global variables, it's easy to assign resources. But what if you want to skip to certain parts of the game?

You should be able to activate certain projects by adding them to active projects.

However I'm getting an error when I try to do that.


```javascript
activeProjects.push(projects[111]);
```


How do I manually show projects? Neither of these flags worked:

```javascript
compflag = 1;
projectsflag = 1;
```
