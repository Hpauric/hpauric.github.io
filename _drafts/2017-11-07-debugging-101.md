How to cheat in the paperclip game.

Because of its use of global variables, it's easy to assign resources. But what if you want to skip to certain parts of the game?

You should be able to activate certain projects by adding them to active projects.

However I'm getting an error when I try to do that.


```javascript
activeProjects.push(projects[111]);
```


How do I manually show projects? Neither of these flags worked:

```javascript
compflag = 1;
projectsflag = 1;
```
