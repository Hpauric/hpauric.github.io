## Using Code

> The key transition character in Razor is the “at” sign (@). This single character is used to transition from markup to code.

The @ transition symbol effectively works as a `console.log` or `println()` mechanism.

Code that is encased in curly brackets will be executed. Code that's simply preceded by `@` will be outputted.

```csharp
@{var test = 10; }
@{test = test -1;}
@test // 9
```




> By including a `@model` statement at the top of the view template file, you can specify the type of object that the view expects.

`@model IEnumerable<Your.Model.Namespace>`

> This @model directive allows you to access the list of movies that the controller passed to the view

###  Layout

By convention, the default layout for an ASP.NET app is named `_Layout.cshtml`.

The default layout is defined in `_ViewStart.cshtml` file in `Views`.

 
## HTML helper methods

The `Html` object is a helper that's exposed using a property on the `System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage base` class. 

Html.DisplayNameFor
Html.DisplayFor
Html.ValidationSummary
Html.EditorFor
Html.LabelFor

### `ActionLink` Method

`Html.ActionLink`
The `ActionLink` method of the helper makes it easy to dynamically generate HTML hyperlinks that link to action methods on controllers. 

```csharp
@Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { id=item.ID }) 
```
arguments
- string linkText
- string actionName (this is the method name unless otherwise specified)
- string controllerName OR object routeValues

### Html.DisplayFor
