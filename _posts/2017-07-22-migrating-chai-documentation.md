chai documentation

Slate's features are: 

- Everything on a single page
- Automatic, smoothly scrolling table of contents

However it doesn't seem to autoscroll the table of contents when it goes below the visible page.

[Woocommerce works for this actually](http://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#delete-a-tax-rate)

On further reflection, it doesn't. The problem is that it doesn't dynamically scroll into view in the table-of-contents when a second-layer item is scrolled into view.

## the original documentation

The documentation is open source. They use some kind of package that automatically generates documentation from the comments.

[You can see it here.](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-docs/blob/8620abe8ba41574bd849899d147701c5b0209d8d/chai.js#L2175)



It uses [codex, A static site generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codex) and [dox, a documentation generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dox).

First of all I had to figure out how the project is compiled. The makefile looked promising.

[Unix Guide](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/make.htm)

> The purpose of the make utility is to determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them. you can use make with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command. In fact, make is not limited to programs. You can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change. 
To prepare to use make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states the commands for updating each file. In a program, typically the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.

> Make does not have any baked-in assumptions about what type of project you have or what languages you’re using, it’s simply a tool for organising sets of shell commands. It has a very simple model: you describe which files each build file in your project depends on, and how to regenerate build files if they are out of date. 

> For example, if file a.txt is generated by concatenating b.txt and c.txt, then we would write this rule in our Makefile:
```shell
a.txt: b.txt c.txt
	cat b.txt c.txt > a.txt
```

> The first line says that `a.txt` (the target) is generated from `b.txt` and `c.txt`(the dependencies). `a.txt` will only be rebuilt if one of its dependencies was changed since a.txt was last changed

> The second line (the recipe) says how to regenerate the target if it’s out of date, which in this case is a simple matter of piping cat into the target file.

It’s customary to make a target called `all` that depends on all your project’s compiled files, and make this the first rule in the Makefile so that running make will run this rule.

So `all: generated_data docs-server` means that `all` is generated from `generated_data` and `docs-server`.

```shell_session
@./node_modules/.bin/dox --raw < ./node_modules/chai/chai.js > _data/chai.json
```

The arrows are Input/Output Redirections
This runs `dox` with the input of `chai.js` and the output of `data/chai.json`.
 
I don’t know how it’s using `codex`. It’s not listed anywhere in the codebase, apart from listed as a dependency in the package json.

For my purposes I don't really need to. Now I know where the documentation json is, I can run the file and extract the data I need.

## Using JSON

Converting JSON to markdown
Let’s forget about how it’s built and just focus on how to get the JSON file.
It’s not in the _data file. I thought it was at first.
Ok, it actually is!
/_data/chai.json
I searched for assert.isNotTrue(tea and found it there.
The JSON is just over 20 thousand lines long.

The JSON I have already has markdown, so these tools aren’t that useful. All that messing around with JSON is just too messy.
I could probably write something simple myself that parses the JSON and outputs what I need.
