Slate's features are: 

- Everything on a single page
- Automatic, smoothly scrolling table of contents

However it doesn't seem to autoscroll the table of contents when it goes below the visible page.

[Woocommerce works for this actually](http://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#delete-a-tax-rate)

On further reflection, it doesn't. The problem is that it doesn't dynamically scroll into view in the table-of-contents when a second-layer item is scrolled into view.
