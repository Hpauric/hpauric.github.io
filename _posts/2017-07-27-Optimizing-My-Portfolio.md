I ran a couple of speed tests for my portfolio site. The results weren't pretty.

I got a 47 / 100 score (Desktop) from Google's Pagespeed insights.

GTMetrix gave me the following stats.

Fully Loaded Time 4.9s 
Total Page Size 2.92MB 
Requests 57 

This is considerably below average! It looks like I have some work to do.

## Gzip compression

The biggest impact will be gzip compression. This is the best bang for your buck in terms of performance gains.
