# Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard short cuts are invaluable for working effectively. The less friction between your mind and the code the better! Here are some of my favorites.

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&larr; or &rarr;</kbd>

Skip forwards or backwards one word.

Holding <kbd>shift</kbd> will select the previous or next word.

<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>&larr; or &rarr;</kbd>

Move the cursor to the end of the line or the beginning of the line.

Holding <kbd>shift<kbd> will select the line.
