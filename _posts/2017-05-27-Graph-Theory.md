> There are generally two standard representations of graphs that are used in graph algorithms, depending on which question is more important.

## Adjacency lists

> Adjacency lists are most useful when we mostly want to enumerate outgoing edges of each node. This is common in search tasks, where we want to find a path from one node to another or compute the distances between pairs of nodes. 

## Adjacency Matrices

## Path Searches

The two most popular algorithms are depth-first search and breadth-first search.
