## Creating Components

There are two ways to create a React Component:
1. Using the class constructor
2. Declaring a variable (const)

> When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class.

You need a method that takes an event as its argument in the `Keypad` class

EventFunctionManager

Then you use this function in the element
